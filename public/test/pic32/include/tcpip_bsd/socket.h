 *                  For sockets of type SOCK_STREAM, the name of the remote endpoint

 *                  addr    - pointer to the the sockaddr structure that will receive 
 *                            the connecting node IP address and port number.

 *
 * Overview:        The accept function is used to accept a connection request queued

 *                  removes the request from the queue, and a new socket is created for

 *                  - When receiving data with a zero copy buffer the user gets just a pointer to a buffer that could belong to the stack

 *                    Once the processing of the received data in the buffer is done the user has to call into the stack to notify that the buffer
