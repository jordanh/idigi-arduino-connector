 * Function:	    void DHCPInit(void)
 *
 * PreCondition:    The program needs to have already initialized
 *		    		TCP/IP stack.
 *
 * Input:           None
 *
 * Output:          None
 *
 * Side Effects:    A socket will be created on the DHCP Port
 *
 * Overview:        The function creates a UDP socket and binds it
 *		    		to the DHCP Port to allow the application to
 *		    		act as a DHCP client. The DHCP client will also
 *                  be placed in SM_DHCP_INIT state.

/*********************************************************************
 * Function:        void DHCPTask(void)
 *
 * PreCondition:    DHCPInit() needs to be called before SNMPTask can
 *		    		effectivity run
 *
 * Input:           None
 *
 * Output:          None
 *
 * Side Effects:    None
 *
 * Overview:        This function will serve as the state machine for the
 *                  DHCP client. As DHCP packets are exchanged between the
 *                  client and the server this task will advance through the
 *                  various state conditions. This task is also responsible
 *                  for monitoring lease experation conditions and handle 
 *					retransmissions.

 * Note:	        None
